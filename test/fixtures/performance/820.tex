$$
 We now leave it to the reader to combine the homology equation \eqref{invertmatrix} and the three equations to show the equality of directed line segments
\begin{equation}\label{equalityofsegments}
h_2( \overline{0c_1}) = \overline{c_2d}.
\end{equation}
With this we can solve the problem.
We see that if we consider $$
